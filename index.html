    <h2>National Parks</h2>
    <p>I love to hike, and I love U.S. National Parks as well. My favorite National Park is 
      the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Gatlinburg, Tennessee. I have only been there 
      twice, but I really enjoyed my time there both times. I think it was better to go during 
      early summer or late spring. This is when the smokiness is most apparent, and the sights 
      are beautiful. The hikes were pretty strenuous, but the view makes it absolutely worth.<p>
